# Hand-Pose-Recognition
Using the Leap Motion and other techniques for recognizing hand poses

For current iteration, use the recorder in conjunction with the leapmotion to record hand poses, then take the resulting out.csv file and move it to the directory with the display code. The display code is currently set to only display one record at a time, and cycling through them without manually altering the code is currently not possible. Changing the i variable on line 257 of index.html will allow other hand poses to be displayed.
